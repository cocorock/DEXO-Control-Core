Summary of the Complete Emergency Stop Node Implementation:
1. Enhanced Emergency Stop Node Features:

SMACH State Machine: Proper 5-state machine (INIT → CALIBRATING → READY → STOPPED → ERROR)
Comprehensive Safety Monitoring: Temperature, torque, error flags, communication timeouts
Configurable Parameters: All thresholds and behaviors configurable via YAML
Thread-Safe Operation: Proper locking for concurrent access
Real-time Monitoring: 10Hz monitoring with configurable frequency

2. Safety Monitoring Capabilities:

Motor Error Detection: Critical error flags trigger immediate e-stop
Temperature Monitoring: Configurable overtemperature protection (default 80°C)
Torque Limiting: Excessive torque detection (default 50Nm)
Communication Timeout: Auto e-stop on motor communication loss
Manual Stop Integration: Immediate response to manual stop triggers

3. State Machine Implementation:

InitState: Waiting for calibration trigger
CalibratingState: Monitoring calibration progress with timeout
ReadyState: Normal operation with continuous safety monitoring
StoppedState: Manual stop mode with resume capability
ErrorState: Fault condition with optional auto-recovery

4. Integration Components:

Dummy Crutches Node: CLI interface for manual testing and control
Configuration System: Complete YAML-based parameter management
Launch Files: Modular launch system for easy deployment
Test Suite: Comprehensive automated testing of all safety features

5. Key Configuration Options:
yaml# Critical safety thresholds
safety:
  max_motor_temperature: 80.0   # °C
  max_torque_error: 50.0        # Nm  
  critical_error_flags: [1,2,4,8] # Bit flags for critical errors

# Emergency behaviors
emergency:
  auto_stop_on_error: true      # Auto e-stop on motor errors
  stop_on_communication_loss: true
  stop_on_temperature: true
6. Usage Instructions:
bash# Start complete system
roslaunch exoskeleton_control exoskeleton_system.launch

# Manual control via dummy crutches
# In the CLI interface:
# 'c' - Start calibration
# 's' - Emergency stop  
# 'r' - Resume operation
# 'q' - Quit

# Test emergency stop functionality
rosrun exoskeleton_control test_emergency_stop.py

# Monitor state machine (optional)
roslaunch exoskeleton_control emergency_stop.launch start_smach_viewer:=true
7. Initial Testing Comments:
python# FOR INITIAL TESTING - FOCUS ON:
# 1. Basic state transitions (INIT → CALIBRATING → READY)
# 2. Manual stop/resume functionality  
# 3. Emergency stop message publishing
# 4. Configuration parameter loading

# FOR INITIAL TESTING - CAN DISABLE:
# - Auto-recovery features (set auto_recovery: false)
# - Advanced torque/position monitoring
# - Hardware-specific integrations
The Emergency Stop Node now provides comprehensive safety monitoring with proper state machine management, configurable parameters, and robust testing capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with your motor control system and provides the safety-first approach essential for exoskeleton operation.
